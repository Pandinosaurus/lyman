v0.0.7 (Unreleased)
-------------------

Model workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Upgraded the model workflow to be compatible with FSL 5.0.7 and later. If you
  upgrade lyman, you will have to upgrade your FSL installation (i.e. it does
  not maintain backwards compatibility with older FSL). You should also upgrade
  to nipype 0.10. The main advantage of upgrading should be increased memory
  performance in the model estimation.

Registration workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added the ability to do cross-experiment registration, e.g. in the case where
  you have a functional localizer. This is accomplished through the ``-regexp``
  flag in ``run_fmri.py``. For example, the cmdline
  ``run_fmri.py -exp A -regexp B -regspace epi -timeseries`` will combine
  the func-to-anat matrices from experiment A and the anat-to-func
  matrix from the first run of experiment B, placing the experiment A
  files in a common space with experiment B files.

Anatomy snapshots script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added plots of the native white and pial surfaces
- Surface plots are now saved in one image file with all views,
  and the subplot size is automatically inferred to maximize the
  usage of space
- Added ventral views to the surface images
- Changed how the surface normalization is summarized. The new
  visualization highlights vertices where the binarized curvature
  value is different between the normalized subject and template
- Remove the "-noclose" option, as better ways to avoid the problem
  that motivated it have been identified.

Note that there are corresponding changes in ziegler that are needed to
properly view the new images, and there isn't backwards compatability
with the old outputs. This script can be rerun on older lyman analyses
ithout affecting anything.

Mixed-effects workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated the mixed effects boxplot code for compatibility with seaborn 0.6.
