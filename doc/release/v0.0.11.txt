v0.0.11 (Unreleased)
--------------------

- Fixed slice time correction for data collected on a Siemens scanner. The Siemens interleaved pulse sequence changes the order of slices depending on whether there is an odd or even number of slices (for some insane reason). It is now possible to set ``interleaved="siemens"`` in your experiment file to handle this issue properly. See `this blog post <https://practicalfmri.blogspot.com/2012/07/siemens-slice-ordering.html>`_ for more information.

- The ``lyman.mvpa`` module has been removed.

- Added the ``view_ffx_results.py`` script, which is a wrapper around ``Freeview`` to boot up a useful visualization of fixed effects statistics on the high-resolution anatomical image and surface mesh.

- Added the ``view_reg.py`` script, which is a wrapper around ``Freeview`` to boot up a useful visualization of the functional-to-anatomical registration quality.
