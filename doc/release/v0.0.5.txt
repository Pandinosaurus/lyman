Preprocessing workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a workaround some changes in later versions of FSL
  that now return a de-meaned timeseries from the highpass filter.
  In FEAT, the mean is replaced, and the rest of the processing carries
  on as usual. Because I don't want to break compatability with older
  versions of FSL, this adds back in the mean but only if it looks
  like the filtered timeseries has been de-meaned. **Note**: This uses
  a simple heuristic, which may not be robust in all cases, so it is
  important to check that the signal-to-noise maps make sense if you are
  doing something that expects a nonzero timeseries mean.
