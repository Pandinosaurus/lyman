Infrastructure

- Added continuous integration with TravisCI.

Mixed effects workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug where the analysis mask was getting smoothed on the surface.

FNIRT-based normalization workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug where the outputs of FNIRT were not properly renamed and thus

  pipeline.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug where surface visualization would crash when the analysis mask
  includes all vertices.

- Added a brief pause between updating the view and saving a snapshot to allow
