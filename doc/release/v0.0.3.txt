v.0.0.3 (??)
------------

Preprocessing workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added the ``coreg_init`` field to the experiment file. This is ``"fsl"`` by
  default, which uses ``FLIRT`` to get a rough coregistration before using the
  boundary-based algorithm (this was the old behavior). It can also be set to
  ``"header"``, which assumes that the functional and anatomy are roughly in
  register in real space and that a mapping can be found with the header
  geometry.

Model workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added the ``memory_request`` field to the experiment file so that you can
  request more memory on memory-intensive nodes (those involving model
  estimation) when using a managed distribution engine (such as SGE). This can
  be helpful for whole-brain high-resolution studies.
