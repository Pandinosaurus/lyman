v0.0.7 (February 26, 2015)
--------------------------

Execution
~~~~~~~~~

- Added the option to submit jobs using slurm.
- Added the ``crash_dir`` parameter at the project level (i.e. it will be
  defined when you run ``setup_project.py`` and will be stored in
  ``$LYMAN_DIR/project.py``). This allows you to specify where debugging
  information will be written if something goes wrong during workflow
  execution. The previous approach to selecting where crash files would be
  written was not robust in all execution contexts. **Important:** if you
  upgrade to this version and try to rerun something in an existing project,
  you will get an error.  This can be avoided by defining ``crash_dir`` in your
  project file. These files are usually only transiently useful, so the default
  location for new projects is ``/tmp/nipype-$USER-crashes``.

Registration workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ability to register the residual timeseries after model-fitting, using
  the ``-residual`` flag in ``run_fmri.py`` when ``reg`` is in the workflow
  spec. This file will be called ``res4d_xfm.nii.gz`` in the registration
  output.
