Lyman is a platform for analyzing neuroimaging (primarily MRI) data using
Python. It offers a command-line based interface to a set of `Nipype
<http://nipype.readthedocs.io>`_ data processing workflows and a library of
classes and functions for signal processing, model fitting, visualization and
other tasks.

Lyman integrates tools from several different packages to support a powerful,
flexible, and reproducible approach to data analysis. Image processing is
highly automated and requires minimal manual intervention while generating
numerous static visualizations to enable rigorous quality control.

Lyman is distributed with some hope that it might be useful but no promise of
support or stability. The platform supports a specific approach to analyzing
data and may not work for every study. The code is documented, but not every
aspect of how the tools should be used will be obvious. Finally, the code is likely to change between releases without backwards compatibility.
