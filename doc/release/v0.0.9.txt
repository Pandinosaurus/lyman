v 0.0.9 (Unreleased)
--------------------

Preproc workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added the ability to supply fieldmap images that can be used to unwarp
  distortions caused by dropout regions. This uses FSL's ``topup`` and
  ``applytopup`` utilities. The images you should provide aren't actually
  traditional "fieldmaps", but rather images with normal and reversed phase
  encoding directions, from which a map of the distortions can be computed.


Model workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made some changes to the model summary node to use memory more efficiently.
  The model summary code should now use a similar amount of memory as the
  ``film_gls`` model fitting process.
