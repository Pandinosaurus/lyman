v0.0.2 (??)
-----------

- Added ANTS-based volume normalization. This provides substantial improvements
  over the FSL-based normalization that was previously used. However, ANTS can
  be difficult to install, so this is optional and off by default. It controled
  through a variable in the ``project.py`` file, ``ants_normalization``, which
  should be either ``True`` or ``False``. After enabling it, you can use the
  command-line tools as before, and ANTS will be used in ``run_warp.py`` and
  ``run_fmri.py -workflow reg``.

- Updated the preprocessing workflow in several ways

    - The artifact detection code now uses robust metrics (median and median
      absolute deviation). Previously, it used mean and standard deviation.
      **Importantly**, this means that the your intensity threshold should be
      adjusted by a scaling factor to provide a similarly stringent threshold.
      As a general rule of thumb, 1 SD is about 1.48 MADs.

    - Added white noise spike detection. This is controlled through the
      ``spike_threshod`` in the experiment file. It is also in units of median
      absolute deviation. It is ``None`` by default, indicating that no volumes
      will be excluded for white noise spikes. Additionally, a plot that can be
      used to diagnose spikes has been added to the artifact detection report.

    - Changed the derivation of the brain mask. Previously, this mask was
      intensity based (although the intensity threshold was determined within a
      mask output by BET). Now, the Freesurfer segmentation is used to define
      an anatomical brain mask, which is then transformed into native run
      space. This should avoid losing voxels in magnetic susceptibility areas
      like ventral temporal cortex.

    - Otherwise updated the preproc report with better summary figures.

- Updated the timeseries model workflow in several ways

    - It should now be possible to run the model workflow on task-free data
      (i.e. for functional connectivity analysis) by setting "``design_name``"
      to ``None`` in the experiment file.

    - Added computation and reporting of residual tSNR.

    - Improved the colormaps used for reporting summary statistics about the
      mode (residual variance, R squared, etc.)

    - Improved the plot showing correlations between confound and task
      variables

    - Otherwise improved the logic and testing of the model workflow.

- Updated the mixed effects model reporting and simplified the workflow graph.

    - The boxplot of COPE effect sizes in the mixed effects report is now taken
      from a sphere (with the same size as in the activation peak image)
      centered at each peak voxel rather than just from the single voxel
      itself.
