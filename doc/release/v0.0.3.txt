Model workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added the ``memory_request`` field to the experiment file so that you can
  request more memory on memory-intensive nodes (those involving model
  estimation) when using a managed distribution engine (such as SGE). This can
  be helpful for whole-brain high-resolution studies.
