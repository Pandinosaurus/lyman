Lyman is a platform for analyzing neuroimaging (primarily MRI) data using
Python. It offers a command-line based interface to a set of `Nipype
<http://nipype.readthedocs.io>`_ data processing workflows and a library of
classes and functions for signal processing, model fitting, visualization and
other tasks.

Lyman is publicly released with some hope that it might be useful but no
promise of support or stability. There has been some effort put into
documentation, but not every aspect of using the tools will be obvious. Lyman
supports a specific approach to analyzing data and may not work for every
study. Finally, the code may change between releases in a way that is not
backwards compatible.
