v0.0.7 (Unreleased)
-------------------

Model workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Upgraded the model workflow to be compatible with FSL 5.0.7 and later. If you
  upgrade lyman, you will have to upgrade your FSL installation (i.e. it does
  not maintain backwards compatibility with older FSL). You should also upgrade
  to nipype 0.10. The main advantage of upgrading should be increased memory
  performance in the model estimation.

Mixed-effects workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated the mixed effects boxplot code for compatibility with seaborn 0.6.
