Command-Line Interface
======================

The Nipype workflows for processing MRI data and estimating univariate models
are controlled through a set of command-line scripts, in concert with the
experiment and design information. For information about what these scripts do and how to use them, you can run ``<script_name> -h``. The help information is also reproduced on this page.
